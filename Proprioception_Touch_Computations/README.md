# Feature-dependent somatosensory computations

Note: For the details of the experimental design, data collection, figures, and results, please see the preprint at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/12/283218

Matlab script smartbar.m is required for many of the plots. The script is located under Experiment 1 folder.

All Matlab scripts run on MATLAB_R2014a. Based on my experience, the later versions may encounter a problem with a function errorbar_tick(). This function is available in MATLAB_R2014a, but may not in later versions. If this problem pops up, comment the lines that include errorbar_tick() function. This will affect nothing but the appearances of the error bars.

Built-in function aicbic(), used to compute model comparison metrics, is available in Econometrics Toolbox.
