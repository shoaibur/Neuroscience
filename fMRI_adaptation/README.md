# fMRI adaptation

Sensory information is represented and elaborated in hierarchical cortical systems that are thought to be dedicated to individual sensory modalities. This traditional view of sensory cortex organization has been challenged by recent evidence of multimodal responses in primary and association sensory areas. Although it is indisputable that sensory areas respond to multiple modalities, it remains unclear whether these multimodal responses reflect selective information processing for particular stimulus features. Here, we used fMRI adaptation to identify brain regions that are sensitive to the temporal frequency information contained in auditory, tactile, and audiotactile stimulus sequences. A number of brain regions distributed over the parietal and temporal lobes exhibited frequency-selectivity for both audition and touch, as indexed by repetition suppression effects. A smaller set of regions responded to crossmodal adaptation sequences in a frequency-dependent manner. Despite the extensive overlap of multimodal frequency-selective responses across the parietal and temporal lobes, regional patterns of the representational spaces occupied by the stimulus sequences and of spontaneous signal fluctuations clearly reflect distinct somatosensory and auditory hierarchical pathways. These results reveal that multimodal processing in human cortex can be feature specific and that multimodal circuits are embedded in traditional sensory cortex hierarchies.
